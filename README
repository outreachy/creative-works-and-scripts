Outreachy is a volunteer organization under the Software Freedom Conservancy
that provides internships and mentoring in Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS). Outreachy coordination tasks include promotion, herding project
mentors, and a whole lot of data wrangling. This repository includes scripts I
create to help me with those tasks, updated artwork for promoting Outreachy,
and anything that's public and needs to be under revision control.

Outreachy is open for all those who are under-represented in technology. 
This can be your life-changing oppportunity to work with the great minds and build your career to a better form.
Spend some time with pateince, take help and go ahead!
Wishing you all the best from team Outreachy :)
